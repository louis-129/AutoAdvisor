Project Name: Auto Advisor 

Description of Project: My project is a simple app where users can 
create and read reviews of vehicles. The user can create car or 
motorcycle reviews, and then can filter the reviews based off the type
of Vehicle. I wanted to create a project like this because of the 
struggle that I have been having in buying a car, it seems most review
don't even tell the truth. https://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/, this
is the site that I have been using for my personal use and I 
wanted to base my project to become a really simple version of this.
